understanding.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/components":{"id":"architecture/components","title":"Components","description":"Let\'s breakdown an Ambient web app. It needs a few things:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/envars":{"id":"architecture/envars","title":"Environment Variables","description":"Environment variables are one way to get information into the app at runtime. At a minimum, Ambient (more precisely the Session Manager) needs to have a session key so it can encrypt user sessions. Ambient is not opinioned about how you load the environment variables so you can load them from anywhere. We use the github.com/joho/godotenv package for reading from .env files.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/logger":{"id":"architecture/logger","title":"Logger","description":"Developing a logging strategy is a good practice when you start building an app because it will help you develop and troubleshoot more quickly. Ambient supports the following log levels in plugins:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/router":{"id":"architecture/router","title":"Router","description":"The router determines which handlers are called when a request hits the app based on HTTP method (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) and URL. Every router handles routes a little differently so if you want to extend a router that already exists, it needs to meet the minimum requirements","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/session":{"id":"architecture/session","title":"Session Manager","description":"The session manager handles all aspects of a user session like:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/storage":{"id":"architecture/storage","title":"Storage System","description":"Ambient is a dynamic app that allows you make changes to it while it is running like enabling/disabling plugins, changing site information, etc. Those changes are stored in a JSON configuration object and then written to a storage system so it\'s persistent. Since there is a storage system, multiple instances of the app can run at the same time and access the same storage system to keep them consistent. This allows Ambient to support container and serverless architectures with ease because that storage system can be shared.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/template-engine":{"id":"architecture/template-engine","title":"Template Engine","description":"The template engine is what parses, and modifies, and organizes HTML content before it\'s sent back to the requesting client. It provides a lot of the extensibility that makes the Ambient plugin architecture possible. If you are returning JSON or XML, you won\'t need to use the template engine.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/amb":{"id":"cli/amb","title":"amb","description":"Ambient has a CLI app called amb that allows you to create new projects and interact with running apps.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/createapp":{"id":"cli/createapp","title":"createapp","description":"Create a new Ambient app on your computer.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/decryptstorage":{"id":"cli/decryptstorage","title":"decryptstorage","description":"Decrypt the data storage (storage/site.bin) for a running Ambient app.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/devconsole":{"id":"cli/devconsole","title":"Dev Console","description":"The Dev Console is a web API that the amb CLI uses to make changes to an Ambient app configuration. It allows the CLI to make changes without the need for access to sensitive values like encryption keys that are used to encrypt the app configuration. It\'s disabled by default, but can be enabled and configured in an Ambient app using environment variables. It should be disabled in production so the app configuration cannot be modified without explicit permission.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/enable":{"id":"cli/enable","title":"enable","description":"Enable either a specified plugin or all plugins for a running Ambient app.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/encryptstorage":{"id":"cli/encryptstorage","title":"encryptstorage","description":"Encrypt the data storage (storage/site.bin) for a running Ambient app.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli/grant":{"id":"cli/grant","title":"grant","description":"Approve all grant requests for either a specified plugin or all plugins.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"faq":{"id":"faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","description":"What is Ambient?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/quickstart":{"id":"introduction/quickstart","title":"Welcome!","description":"Ambient is a framework in Go for building web apps using plugins. You can use the plugins already included to stand up a blog just like the Bear Blog or create your own plugins to build your own app. Plugins can be enabled/disabled while the app is running which means routes as well as middleware can also modified without restarting the app. Plugins must be granted permissions above being enabled which provides you with better control over your app.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/screenshots":{"id":"introduction/screenshots","title":"Screenshots","description":"Below are screenshots of a full app with links to the plugins to help explain the architecture.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/assets":{"id":"plugins/assets","title":"Assets","description":"The Assets() function returns a list of assets that can modify the template output. They can be used to link to local resources like stylesheets and javascript files or they can link to external resources. You can also define the header and footer for template output. Assets support templating from a string or from a template. You can even add HTML tags to the template output. They are pretty powerful and support a bunch of use cases.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/docgen":{"id":"plugins/docgen","title":"Doc Generation","description":"The goal of the documentation is to make it easy for other developers to see how the plugin will behave when it\'s added to their Ambient app. Also, documentation is not always fun to write and keep updated so this should help!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/enable":{"id":"plugins/enable","title":"Enable & Disable","description":"The Enable() and Disable() functions are optional. They allow the plugin to perform tasks when the plugin is enabled or disabled. Examples of why a plugin would need to use these functions:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/funcmaps":{"id":"plugins/funcmaps","title":"FuncMaps","description":"FuncMaps are how you can call functions in HTML templates to return data. They are a map of functions that can take in parameters.

It\'s helpful when you can provide more information during troubleshooting by changing the log level because you can get to the bottom of issues quicker. The logger is used by the Ambient internal system and is made available to plugins as well.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/middleware":{"id":"plugins/middleware","title":"Middleware","description":"Middleware runs code before or after a route is served.

The full list of grants available is here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plugins/practices":{"id":"plugins/practices","title":"Best Practices","description":"- Use the Ambient logger with all it\'s different levels: error, warn, info, and debug.
