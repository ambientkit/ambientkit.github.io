# ambient-template

The [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repository contains a full app to demonstrate how to use the [Ambient](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient) pluggable web framework.

The app was modeled after the [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) by [Herman Martinus](https://herman.bearblog.dev/).

To set up the app, follow the [Quickstart](/docs/introduction/quickstart#getting-started) guide. The `amb` cli does support [creating projects from your own templates](/docs/cli/createapp).

The environment variables available are documented [here](/docs/architecture/envars).

:::tip Create your own template

Feel free to fork the [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repo and make changes or make a repo from scratch to better suit your needs.
