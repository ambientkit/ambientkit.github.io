# createapp

Create a new Ambient app on your computer.

Create app with defaults. The [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repo will be downloaded to a folder named `ambapp`.

```bash
createapp
```

You can also run by specifying your own arguments. This is helpful if you have your own [Ambient template](/docs/docs/template/app) you want to use.

```bash
createapp -folder ambapp -template http://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template
```

:::tip Create your own template

Feel free to fork the [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repo and make changes or make a repo from scratch to better suit your needs.
