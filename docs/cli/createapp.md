# createapp

Create a new Ambient application on your computer.

Create app with defaults. The [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repo will be downloaded to a folder named `ambapp`.

```bash
createapp
```

You can also run by specifying your own arguments. This is helpful if you have your own Ambient template you want to use. Feel free to fork the [`ambient-template`](https://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template) repo and make changes to better suit your needs.

```bash
createapp -folder ambapp -template http://github.com/ambientkit/ambient-template
```
